# Note Taker Application
This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Description
This challenge was intended to test our knowledge of foundational server side functions using Express. The front end code was provided and we were tasked with building the server side code.

## How to use
From the landing page click on "Get Started" to be redirected to the notes page.

Once on the notes page you will see a list of all notes on the left side. In the main panel you will have the option to create new note by clicking on the empty note title/text and start typing to create a new note. Once a new note is selected there will be a save icon that will appear, click this to save the current note to the json db file.

## What I learned
* Basic server environment and CRUD operations using Express.
* I enjoy working with and building server side API code

## Future development
I don't have plans to develop this code in the future, this was a helpful exercise to learn about Express and I will revisit if I need a refresher!

## Credits
Thanks to the University of Texas and my instructor Leah.
